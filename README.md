# AR / MR in the Web

This project is realized by using [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md) and [A-Frame](http://aframe.io/). AR.js is an open source and pure web solution for creating augmented reality in the web. It is standard and works with any mobile device with webgl and webrtc. A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. It works on Vive, Rift, desktop and mobile platforms.

Anyone with a camera-enabled browser will be able to enjoy mixed reality here.

2. Open the link on your mobile device using a browser. Enable your browser to use camera. Pointing to the marker and you will see a 3D object floating above the marker.
