# AR / MR in the Web

This project is realized by using [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md) and [A-Frame](http://aframe.io/). AR.js is an open source and pure web solution for creating augmented reality in the web. It is standard and works with any mobile device with webgl and webrtc. A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. It works on Vive, Rift, desktop and mobile platforms.

Anyone with a camera-enabled browser will be able to enjoy mixed reality here.

## How to use this?

| Open URL on one device                                       | Open Marker on separate device                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scan the QR code or Open **https://git.io/fNxOo** on a separate mobile device. | Open the following marker on one device. Or print it out.    |
| <img src="./marker/qrcode.png" width=250px>                  | <a href="./marker/robot_marker.png"><img src="./marker/robot_marker.png" width="700px"></a> |

Enable your browser to use camera, then pointing to the marker. You will see a 3D object floating above the marker.
