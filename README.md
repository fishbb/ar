# AR / MR in the Web

This project is realized by using [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md) and [A-Frame](http://aframe.io/). AR.js is an open source and pure web solution for creating augmented reality in the web. It is standard and works with any mobile device with webgl and webrtc. A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. It works on Vive, Rift, desktop and mobile platforms.

Anyone with a camera-enabled browser will be able to enjoy mixed reality here. Plus, the examples are now available in the [distributed web](#available-now-in-the-distributed-web).

## How to use this?

### **Example one:** 

1. Open **[https://bit.ly/2Nsf9YD](https://bit.ly/2Nsf9YD)** in Chrome on a mobile device. 
2. Open the following marker on a separete device. Or print it out. 
 <a href="./marker/robot_marker.png"><img src="./marker/robot_marker.png" width="600px"></a> 
3. Enable your browser to use camera, then pointing to the marker. You will see a 3D object floating above the marker. 

### **Example two:** 

1. Open **[https://bit.ly/2MCwhOT](https://bit.ly/2MCwhOT)** in Chrome on a mobile device. 
2. Open the following marker on a separete device. Or print it out. 
 <a href="./marker/robot_marker.png"><img src="./marker/robot_marker.png" width="600px"></a> 
3. Enable your browser to use camera, then pointing to the marker. You will see a 3D object floating above the marker. 

### **Example three:** 

1. Open **[https://bit.ly/2TXRkLu](https://bit.ly/2TXRkLu)** in Chrome on a mobile device. 
2. Open the following marker on a separete device. Or print it out. 
 <a href="./marker/robot_marker.png"><img src="./marker/code4lib.png" width="600px"></a> 
3. Enable your browser to use camera, then pointing to the marker. You will see a 3D object floating above the marker. 

## Available now in the distributed web

The AR example is now available in the distributed web. It is shared on the blockchain through InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which means it is part of the distributed web -- the more people store the file on the blockchain, the more accessible it becomes. 

To experience AR in IPFS, follow the steps:

1. Open the [marker](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcMyhMoG6sotqQWuRrtXDGd7C2smwzKz6J5Ks1MXfkeYH/robot_marker.png) on one device or print it out.
2. Open **[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcMyhMoG6sotqQWuRrtXDGd7C2smwzKz6J5Ks1MXfkeYH/](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcMyhMoG6sotqQWuRrtXDGd7C2smwzKz6J5Ks1MXfkeYH/)** or its shortened url https://bit.ly/2t8qaWj in Chrome on a mobile device.

### Share it!

If you want to help supporting the accessibility of this example, please [install IPFS](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/) and then run the following commands:

```IPFS
ipfs pin add QmcMyhMoG6sotqQWuRrtXDGd7C2smwzKz6J5Ks1MXfkeYH
```
